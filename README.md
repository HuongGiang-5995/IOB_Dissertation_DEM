# This dissertation utilizes panel data from 81 low and lower middle-income countries covering the 1990-2019 period, to examine the impact of aid, aid volatility and institutional quality on universal health coverage in those countries. A distinctive aspect of this study lies in its exploration of aid volatility (health sector aid) and their interaction with institutional quality indicators, using “coverage of essential health services” and “catastrophic health spending” as indicators for universal health coverage. By expanding upon previous research in this field, the dissertation aims to shed light on the significant relationship between aid volatility, institutional quality, and universal health coverage. This study employs mixed-effects regression models, and dynamic Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimators to capture possible endogeneity issues, in order to add further confidence on evidence on the above important nexus.
